# vuemix

A simple POC of a remix-like framework for Vue 3

## Usage

```bash
> npm ci
> npm run build
> npm run start
```

This will build the server/client apps with [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) and launch an [`express`](https://expressjs.com/) server at http://localhost:8080 which demonstrates a few routes and loaders/actions.
